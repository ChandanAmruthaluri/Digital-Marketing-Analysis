# 📢 Digital Marketing Campaign Analysis

## Project Overview
Analyzed multi-channel ad performance (Facebook, Google, TikTok, LinkedIn) to determine the most efficient acquisition channels. Focus was on optimizing ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) and identifying funnel drop-off points.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python:** Generated synthetic marketing logs including Impressions, Clicks, Spend, and Conversions.
* **SQL:** Structured and queried campaign performance data.
* **Power BI:** Visualized the conversion funnel and calculated key efficiency metrics (CPC, CTR, ROAS).

## 💡 Key Findings
* **Tiktok Wins:** Unexpectedly, Tiktok Ads provided the highest ROAS, suggesting a successful high-ticket B2B strategy.
* **Funnel Health:** Visualized the drop-off from Impression to Conversion to identify weak campaign messaging.
